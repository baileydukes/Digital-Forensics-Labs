# Welcome to Lab 1

This lab will entail finding a 'corrupted image file' and how we can view this in Autopsy and then HxD in order to make it 'viewable' in both Autopsy and via the OS.

This lab has some prerequisites, please see the below as you will need to download some things:
- Download Autopsy - https://www.autopsy.com/download/
- Download HxD (Hex Editor) - https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/
- Download the [image](Image1)

After you have downloaded the above, you can proceed.

# Step 1. 
Now that we have everything, we want to pretend that we need to do some **Forensic Analysis** on the image file that we have been provided.
